# shortcuts

### Description
Create shortcuts with powershell.  Can be used with Intune, SCCM or manually.  My time doing SCCM deployments SCCM is being used more and more to deploy shortcuts.  While I personally feel this is a better use case for GPO that option is becoming less and less favoriable so here is my contribution to the problem.
